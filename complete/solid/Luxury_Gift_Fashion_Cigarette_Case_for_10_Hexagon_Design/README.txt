# Summary

HOT HOT HOT!!
Are you a smoker?
Trying to smoke less? 
Do you want something cheap that looks good?
Spending valentine's day all by yourself? 
HERE is the answer for all your problems : "LUXURY FASHION CIGARETTE CASE for 10 HEXAGON DESIGN"(probably the longest product name)

Hello guys! I hope you like my design. I made this cigarette case after I decided to lower the amount of cigarettes I smoke. I also tried to make a design that would look good in the outside world, not just a piece of plastic and I think that the simple hexagon pattern gives a luxurios feel to the cheap plastic. (probably less than a dollar for the amount of plastic hihi)

P.S. Download and print fast and leave a comment and a picture about what you think. As soon as I become rich and famous, this case will be very expensive. I expect than in a few days people will start smoking just to use my case!
P.P.S. I do not work for starbucks and I wasn't payed by them. Altho i hope they will give me some money for the pictures.
NOTE: Source file was uploaded. If you just want to print it download the "top.stl" and "bottom.stl" files. Don't forget to share your print.

Update: I  added the 94mm version!

It was printed at 5% infill and speed 60 => around 4 printing hours.
I recommand a higher infill 20-30% should be fine.
