# Summary

*[updated February 5, 2016: should be easier to print. Removed the feet from the insert, thickened the bezel and other sections. Removed some overhangs. Opened up the slot at the top.]*


This is a two-part charging dock for the Apple Watch.

Part 1 (stand) holds the wireless charging puck in place. Part 2 (shell) slides on top, and provides a place to set your Apple Watch. Slots in the sides of the shell hold the watch steady by its band, while the magnetic charger keeps it in place to charge. The screen lines up with the Mac's screen, so you can see the display while the watch is in Night Stand mode.
