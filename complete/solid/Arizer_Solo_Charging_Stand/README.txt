# Summary

This is a charging stand for the Arizer Solo Vaporizer.  It uses the supplied Arizer wall-wart power supply as-is.  The stand is rather primitive -- it was one of my first OpenSCAD designs -- but it works well.  I've been using mine for a little over a year.

The Arizer Solo Vaporizer is a marvelous gadget.  There are a couple of drawbacks to its design, however.  The first:  While it can be used while charging, because the charging port is on the bottom, you can't stand it upright while charging.

The second:  The charging plug is a straight plug instead of a right angle plug -- so I had to design the stand a little taller that I would have liked in order to accommodate the straight plug.

While installing the charging plug into the stand is fairly straightforward, I've included some pics to illustrate the preferred method of getting the plug in there.  Get the plug in first, then work the cord into the "keepers."

After the charging plug is installed into the stand, the plug barrel should be vertical.  But the plug will, at first, lean a bit forward in the stand instead of being vertical.  As the plug's molded-in strain relief gets used to being bent, the plug will stay vertical -- you can help it along by bending the strain relief a bit before you insert it -- see the cutaway pics to help illustrate what I mean.  You can also make the plug more vertical by pushing the cord into the stand a little bit more.

The stand is designed to have the tip of the plug rising just above the sides of the stand so it is the first thing that touches the bottom of the Solo when you're inserting it into the stand.  It's *very* important to insert the Solo into the stand *gently* - without forcing.  Get the plug started into the bottom of the Solo before fully inserting the Solo into the stand.  

I printed this with 20% infill.  You may want a higher percentage to provide more "heft", but even at 100%, when it's empty, it's going to slide around at the mercy of the very stiff charging cord.  When the Solo in in the stand, that's not a problem.

I put a sticky-foam sheet on the bottom (not seen in the pics) to help protect any furniture it's placed upon.  Rubber stick-on feet might be a good idea, too.

[Updated 03/15/18 but only to add two new pictures of the stand printed in Atomic Filament's "Dark Cherry Red".  Plus, in two and a half years, I've learned how to get better prints from my printers.]
